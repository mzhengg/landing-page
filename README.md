# HTML5 and CSS3 Project

This is a project from The Odin Project where I incorporate HTML5 and CSS3, with a strong emphasis on flex boxes, to build a website honoring my favorite pet, Penny.

# Methodology

To follow along this project, I recommend having the HTML file open on one screen and the CSS file on another, since they are connected. The main contents of the website, such as the links, text, and images, are stored in the HTML file. Whenever a modification is made to the elements in the HTML file, it is done in the CSS file by calling the corresponding id names, tags, and class names in the HTML file. Note that the CSS file follows a hierarchical order.
